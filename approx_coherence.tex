\begin{abstract}
% Uni-core processor scaling over that past decade has stagnated due to increasing power consumption for marginal performance gains. Modern computing systems are seeing proliferation into multi-core and many-core processors. Parallel and shared memory applications are becoming increasingly important to fully utilize these current and upcoming architectures. However, the communication bandwidth between compute units is the main bottleneck for further boosts in performance. The key to future advancements lies within the communication infrastructure, ...
