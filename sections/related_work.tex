\section{Related Work}

Recent work \cite{Rengasamy2015} in the domain of approximate computing and cache coherence modifies a protocol to approximate on load values to minimize the effects of false sharing in approximate applications. Processor reads to invalidated cache blocks in the L1-d would supply possibly stale data to the processor instead of stalling to wait for the coherent data. While the processor executes with the potenitally stale data, the protocol concurrently services the miss through standard coherence transactions to obtain coherent data and permissions. To the best of our knowledge, our protocol is the first to tackle these combined domains using stores to leveraging the approximate value locality in error-tolerant applications. Loads on invalid lines stems from invalidations sent by remote cores requesting exlusive access to a block on a store. Instead of extending a protocol to optimize for load misses like in the prior work, we aim our efforts at the source of the problem, the stores. By implementing \storea we are not only able to reduce the amount of store misses, but also the amount of load misses due to fewer lines being invalidated. We also save energy by reducing the amount of coherence traffic and include approaches to bound the error through programmer support.
